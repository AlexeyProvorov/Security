### Business Objective

The main business objective of finding fraud transactions can be following:
* If a fraud transaction is found out, the company should immediately block that card.
* We should be able to predict the probability of fraud transaction
* We should not predict fraud transactions as nonfraud. Also the vice versa. So precision and recall should be taken care of.



### Results
After creating some baseline models we stick up with xgboost as it was giving better perfomance. We did several feature engineering and feature selection and ultimatly end up with a solution which is top 3.5% in kaggle leaderboard. I have written a detailed blog regarding my solution.Please refer this. https://medium.com/@arunm8489/ieee-cis-fraud-detection-top-5-solution-5488fc66e95f.
